# A Design Portfolio on Github

Hello, I'm Struan, a designer with a desire to learn to code a little better. I'm currently hosting using <http://pages.github.io> because they offer a generous, free, hosting service.

Things you can expect to find here and amongst my repos â€“

* Prototypes using <http://framer.co.uk>
* Awful code that is symptomatic of a learning coder
* A poor grasp of Git
* Hubris

Try not to look too closely.
